# Accounting Business: Demo Site

This is a demo site for an accounting business. The idea was to build something fairly simple that reflects the professionalism and straightforwardness of the business. It highlights the services the business offers, but also adds a personal touch by introducing the people involved.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, Inkscape

The site was mostly built from scratch (aside from the JS for the menu), with code written by hand in HTML, CSS, and JS. The logo was created in Inkscape and the images edited in Photoshop. 

## Optimizations

The header does not fully function as intended, though the issue is minor (logo appears on page load when it shouldn't). Upon scrolling, it works as it should. Additionally, copy could be added to flesh out the site, but that is not the focus here. 

## Lessons Learned

This was the first time I implemented a full-screen header style, which resulted in having to handle the proportions of the logo/text in it differently compared to other styles. Essentially, it was an exercise in making sure it looked readable (and not absurdly small or large) on different screen sizes.
